User requested that we remember a cross-project follow-up: look for and reuse a 'talk to the hand' style realtime audio approach (if found in another repo) and align karaoke architecture with it. In this repo, no 'talk to the hand' reference was found; current karaoke is upload + transcribe flow. Also explicitly track follow-up to update 1976.eyjar.app with the same karaoke system used in mybirthday.myx.is.
